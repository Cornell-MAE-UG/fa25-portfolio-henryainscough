# Hi, I’m Henry

I’m an undergraduate in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Cornell University.  
This portfolio explains my experiment with a heat exchanger for 2210 Thermodynamics

On this site you’ll find:

- **Projects** – The writeup
- **Code & analysis** – small snippets of Python / MATLAB or hand calculations

Feel free to explore the **Projects** tab to see more details about what I’ve been working on.
